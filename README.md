# What is Picat programming language?

Picat ([http://picat-lang.org/](http://picat-lang.org/)) is a simple, and yet powerful, logic-based multi-paradigm programming language aimed for general-purpose applications. It was created by Neng-Fa Zhou and Jonathan Fruhman.

Picat is a rule-based language, in which predicates, functions, and actors are defined with pattern-matching rules. Picat incorporates many declarative language features for better productivity of software development, including explicit non-determinism, explicit unification, functions, list comprehensions, constraints, and tabling. Picat also provides imperative language constructs, such as assignments and loops, for programming everyday things.
